	 * use the public method in the class. There will be some kind of
	 * method to set the age (setters) and a method to retrieve the
	 * age (getters).

	/* Constructors 
	 * 
	 * When you don't type any constructors, you get a default constructor
	 * from the compiler. Here is what it looks like:
	 * 
	 * 		public Trainee() {
	 * 			
	 * 		}
	 * 
	 * When you do enter/ type any constructors (e.g. one that take 
	 * parameters), you NO LONGER get a default constructor provided by
	 * the compiler. 
	 * 
	 * If you want a 'default constructor', i.e. you want to still be able
	 * to type following code:
	 * 
	 * 			Trainee t1 = new Trainee();
	 * 
	 * You will have to type your own constructor that take no parameters
	 * and this will be called a 'no-args constructor'. This is what is 
	 * looks like:
	 * 
	 * 		public Trainee() {}
	 * 
	 * A constructor NEVER has a return type. A constructor will set
	 * up an object in memory, set up its member variables with default
	 * values and returns the location in memory of that new object.
	 * 
	 * e.g. 	Trainee t1 = new Trainee();
	 * 
	 * To call this constructor, you could write the following code:
	 * 
	 * 		Trainee t3 = new Trainee("Fred Flintstone", "Bedrock", 25);
	 * 
	 * 					name = "Fred Flintstone"
	 * 			t3 -->  address = "Bedrock"
	 * 					age = 25
	 * 
	 * 
	 * This constructor is called the no-args constructor. 
	 * The one provided by the compiler when you don't insert any 
	 * constructors is called the 'default constructor'.

		 * method because it contains validation. You may set the value

	 * variables as the set methods can include validation, see the 
	 * setAge() method below.
